Overview
++++++++

A quick demo of the API Explorer can be powerful for the appropriate audience. The standard Prism overview demonstrates that Nutanix management is based on modern web standards and doesn't rely on legacy frameworks (Flash, Java). The API demo shows the prospect's ability to integrate our management with virtually any other workflow or application via REST.

This demo is performed from the Prism Central interface. Triggers for this demo include prospects looking to unify and automate their management tools.
